# Contributing

This is a contributor friendly repository! If you have an idea that could improve this script via increased functionality or otherwise, please send me a pull request so we can talk about merging
it into the master branch! Just keep the following in mind before sending the pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1. Test the script before and after making changes to ensure that no current features are broken as a result of any changes made.

2. Update the README.md with details of what was changed, including anything added.

3. Send the pull request and I will merge it into the master branch after proofreading and testing if the changes are warranted.

If I have an issue with the contents of the pull request, we will have a fair discussion in the comments, or also feel free to send me an email at bmbawb@gmail.com. 
If I do not already have permissions to commit to your branch, I may ask for it to help facilitate the process.

Finally, thanks for wanting to contribute!
